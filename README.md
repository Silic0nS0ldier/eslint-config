# ESLint Config Monorepo

This repository houses the baseline (plain JavaScript) `silicon-soldier` ESLint configuration, plus its complementary extensions that enable support for other scenarios such as TypeScript.

## Roadmap

This roadmap will eventually be relocated to the wiki.

### 1.0.0

- [x] Improve dog-fooding experience.
- [ ] Improve ruleset tests with pass and fail scenarios to permit catching of regressions and breaks from existing style.
- [ ] Document code style.
- [ ] Implement CI.

### 2.0.0

- [ ] Prefer JSX syntax for XML derivatives when detected in a string.
- [ ] JSDoc enforcement.
